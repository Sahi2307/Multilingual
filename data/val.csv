In short here is what you see: 1) Mounds of sand/mud along the sides or medians of the ORR in many stretches including flyovers, maximum after the More flyover when going towards KR Puram station. These mounds are not natural formations, they have been made by someone, quite obvious by the people who have swept the road, perhaps with the intention that it would be picked up by another team , but then that has not happened. These mounds of mud still exist in after a month! 2) You can see the same mounds of mud and sand on the top portion of flyover to Kasturinagar from Tin Factory. The mud and sand are neatly arranged as small mountains( kids might love to see them !! ) on the footpath. Again they exist till date!! 3) The state of underpasses at the center of the underpass right under the bridge on top, should be seen, mainly the Ram Murthy Nagar and Horamavu underpass. You can see lot of sand/mud on the side of the road along with lot of the same accumulated on the footpaths. If a two wheeler goes towards the side of the roads in speed, the rider is sure of getting the ""last ride"". I can go on and on listing such stuff. The same scenes can be seen on Indiranagar 100 ft road, sarjapur road, old airport road etc. I fail to understand this!! When someone has swept the road, am sure some money would have paid for doing the same, why is the stuff not being picked up!! Instead it is left lying there, in fact you can see plants growing in many of these sand/mud mounds!! Can't Bangalore have cleaner roads, is it that difficult? Many a times citizens add to the mess by throwing garbage on top of these mounds of sand/mud. Please stop doing this!! I have not seen this state in any other city. The idea of taking the pics was that reaches the concerned authorities and they take some action. Now, just uploading the photos( around 50 of them ) would have been very boring.

English translation: Hello, I am writing this email in connection with the development of the BDA area of Bangalore-[PHONE], in front of Banashankari 6th Stage, 11th Cross, Municipal Road, Kanakapura Road, Shobha Forest View Apartments. I have been living with my family at the address mentioned above for 11 years. Unfortunately, the drainage system and roads have not yet been developed. It feels like we are living in the British era. It is assigned to us as a BDA site. We have been contacting authorities for 11 years. There are only false hopes. When officials are asked by the BDA, they blame the BBMP for lack of sewage and road development. Lack of proper drainage systems, many mosquitoes, can cause health problems. We have senior citizens living here. It is unfortunate that this is still lacking in these areas of Bengaluru by [PHONE] with respect to the 'Clean Bharat Mission' launched by our Honorable Prime Minister Modiji. The so-called politicians just used the mantra to get votes and nothing else. I recently sent emails to [EMAIL] , [EMAIL] , [EMAIL] but no reply . Do they have these emails but not for responding to the problems of the general public? I attached photos of roads and drainage in our area. Please request that you check the photos and bring it in and help us get the right roads and drainage system rights pending for more than 11 years. Thanks in advance. There is hope to see change!

We work in companies in Bangalore for the welfare of the city. Everyone knows that bangalore is a city of great MNCs. So it's obvious that people want to come here to work. People work in bangalore which will benefit both government and to their self. Bangalore is a costly city, the cost of living here is so much compared to other cities but still people come to this city to make their livelihood. It's your responsibility to provide at least basic facilities to the people who came here far away from their house. And the basic thing is good condition of roads. As there are so many companies in bangalore, there will be so many people around the office at a distance of 2-3 km. They may prefer to come by bus or by foot. Even if they take a bmtc bus, they still wants to walk a certain distance to reach a bus stop. But here the footpaths are in such a bad condition that it looks like a mud path rather than a footpath. Even with a light drizzle, the footpath becomes so dirty that people have to walk on the bricks side to the footpath. Then what is the use of having footpath if people are walking on the bricks? I am working in a company in ITPL, whitefield. There is a footpath between brigade bhuwalka icon to international tech park and from international tech park to the den hotel. The path in between itpl and den is so bad. It's in the worst condition. That path is full of mud and there are no cement bricks on it. And whenever rain happens it will become a mini pond. There will be hundreds of people walking in that path everyday. As bangalore state government, it's your responsibility to take care of these footpaths. If you are not able to make a full path of cement bricks, atleast make a row of those so that people can walk on it in a line. Please I request you to take care of these paths. Because of that mud, we are suffering so much. I again request you to please take care of these roads. I am not asking you to give us money or jewellery, nor we are asking to decrease our cost of living here. We are just asking you to give us proper roads because from morning till night, roads play a major role in our lives. Those are the main source which take us from one part to another part.
