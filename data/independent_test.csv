Hi,

I live in RRnagar, uttarahalli , Bangalore.In the locality garbage has become a humongous issue. Garbage is not collected in regular intervals [In some dead end roads, garbage has not been collected ever]. Because of which people tend to throw garbage in any empty spot next to rods, houses and shops. Which, not just looks bad but also make the residents prone to many contagious diseases. 
I request the concerned department to look into the issue and provide a solution as early as possible.

Due to this crisis situation the electricity consumption has increased drastically and due to that there are electricity related issues in the neighborhood ( we are also being affected by this). I also believe that this pole has crossed the threshold number of connections to household and it is also supplying power to a factory. Some affected people are coming for a physical fight without following social distancing and precautionary measures as they are in an assumption that since our house is closest to the pole we are involved in manipulating it and causing the trouble.We are being abused physically and mentally, today 18th August they tried to encroach into our building . KEB had confirmed in their presence that issue is caused due to high consumption and they have to fix it but they have not acted upon it.

C1315,Water Supply,"5-1-2019 08:29 191 BESCOM Power Cut Issues since past 3 years Respected Sir/Madam,

We have been observing BESCOM power cut of different category, and it has been going on for last 3 years, would have raised complaints in 100's (docket number of A category and N category), have met BESCOM officials, but nothing has helped. 

The nature of BESCOM power cut are like this:
1. Frequent BESCOM power cut (2 min, 5 min, 1 hrs, few hrs)
2. BESCOM power cut only in Purva Skywood, when BESCOM power exists in all the street lights and vicinity. 
3. 36 hrs BESCOM power cut (more than a day)
4. we have two phases in Purva Skywood, BESCOM power cut will happen in only one of the phases. 

During my last converstation (9 months back), i was told the area is being developed and will become model sub-division, BESCOM power will be provided with UG cable, we did see UG cable being laid out from HSR Layout to Silver County Road, but we continue to have BESCOM power issues.

As i write this complaint, we have another Frequent BESCOM power cut happening.

Please help.

Thanks

3. 36 hrs BESCOM power cut (more than a day)
4. we have two phases in Purva Skywood, BESCOM power cut will happen in only one of the phases. 

During my last converstation (9 months back), i was told the area is being developed and will become model sub-division, BESCOM power will be provided with UG cable, we did see UG cable being laid out from HSR Layout to Silver County Road, but we continue to have BESCOM power issues.

As i write this complaint, we have another Frequent BESCOM power cut happening.

Please help.

Thanks

We have been observing BESCOM power cut of different category, and it has been going on for last 3 years, would have raised complaints in 100's (docket number of A category and N category), have met BESCOM officials, but nothing has helped. 

The nature of BESCOM power cut are like this:
1. Frequent BESCOM power cut (2 min, 5 min, 1 hrs, few hrs)
2. BESCOM power cut only in Purva Skywood, when BESCOM power exists in all the street lights and vicinity. 
3. 36 hrs BESCOM power cut (more than a day)

I have also paid these bills upto date. To try and resolve the issue of getting water supply I have raised 2 complaints also on the system for this under complaint numbers BWSSB-2020-11-03-208890  and  BWSSB-2020-10-21-204396, which were closed without any reason being given. I have raised a third complaint as well with the number  BWSSB-2021-02-01-246133.

It's been almost 1 Year since the road in our street was dug for sewage. We are living with the damaged road since then. We raised a few complaints from the BBMP Sahaaya portal as well but no action has been taken yet. 

We received an officer Mr. Prasanna's (Asst. Executive Engineer [Jeevanbhima Nagar]) contact number (9844416234) in response to our complaints. We called the officer a number of times. From our conversations, it appeared the officer is dilly dallying. We couldn't get any assurance from him as to when the maintenance work of the road will begin.

Kindly look into this matter.

We all will have a general perception that this place will be super developed as it houses to the premium IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, HP etc. It is true to a certain extent. The roads are clean and developed inside electronics city but as soon as the road leaves the company area and enters to the residential area, the scene completely changes. nYes I am talking here about Neeladri Main Road, Electronics City Phase 1. This is road is not far from the Indian IT boom story, yet thoroughly neglected. This area is having a real estate boom with lots of premium apartments, restaurants, super markets, villas etc. but the road is a torture to the nearby residents and to whoever uses it to travel in and out of Electronics City. 378 bus route more pollution route and next to Mumbai City. At a first look you wont believe this road exists in Bangalore that too in back yard of Indias premium IT hub.nRecently ELCITA developed the road till Wipro but afterwards the road condition is pathetic. The road is full of potholes, potholes and bigger potholes.nProblem faced by people in this arean Jam packed traffic in the evening and morning even with lesser vehicles compared to other area of Bangalore.n You cannot drive straight due to the pot holes resulting the opposite flow of traffic.n Each evening you can see standstill traffic with dead blocks.n As the vehicles travelling slowly due to the bigger potholes, the vehicles coming from behind are trying to overtake and causing the opposite flow to stop. n Each vehicle is trying to overtake as there is no median or road divider marks. n This road is a hell for pedestrians. No place to walk on the road as there is no foot path.n Road is full of dust and it is very difficult to go even in two/four wheelers forget about pedestrians.n Dangerous for children to catch their school busses. nI am no urban expert and not sure who is responsible for the development of the road. I am not sure if it is responsibility of Central Govt, State Govt, BDA, BBMP, ELCITA, Area MP or Area MLA. But I am sure to repair this 1 KM stretch of road it will not take crores of money or years of planning. It is a small stretch of road and a proper road will benefit not only the residents of this area but also for those who travel thru this road to Electronics City.nPossible Solutionn Pothole free proper road will solve 80% of the problems.n Proper marking on the road as median is not possiblen Foot path for pedestrians with drainsn No Parking sign boards at proper places and crossings.nnThis Neeladri road being a newer area in Bangalore map, we expect this to be properly planned and good for living.
