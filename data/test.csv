I even complained through BBMP sahaya app, but nothing happened. My wife was twice admitted to hospital for dengue, due to this garbage vehicle and add to this we have to breathe the stinking wastes disposed by all the other residents including PGs and commercial establishments. We now have a 1 month old baby as well and I have again asked him not to park it there, he has given corona excuse and continued to park. Kindly assist me in solving this issue. Thanking you.

They come in cars, commercial vehicles and bikes to throw the trash there, when we stop them they say the garbage is already there!

This problem needs to be solved intelligently, the BandAid Method will not work. Need finite solutions. So some 50 house in this area are dumping the garbage in front of my house. I can help with solution but need you (BBMP) to cooperate to ensure this gets resolved. Please do the needful. Leaders MUST lead by example. Hope the commissioner is interested to lead by example. PS: We appreciate that with our continuous verbal complaints there has been clearing out multiple times sometimes, but we do need to ensure the dumping is completely stopped. We are ready to do our bit, but need the BBMP support to ensure this is done and final. NO More Dumping in front of our house.
